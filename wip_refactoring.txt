WIP Refactoring Progress

market_analyzer.py:
✓ Issues identified:
- Missing datetime import
- Methods need better organization and splitting
- Missing type hints
- Some methods are too complex (high cyclomatic complexity)

Planned Refactoring:
1. Add missing imports and type hints
2. Split complex methods:
   - analyze_price_trend() -> split into separate indicator calculations
   - calculate_trend_strength() -> extract component calculations
   - validate_market_conditions() -> separate validation logic
3. Create new classes/modules:
   - Indicators (RSI, EMA, ADX calculations)
   - MarketValidation (spread, volume, health checks)
   - TrendAnalysis (trend strength, direction analysis)

Next Steps:
1. Add missing datetime import and type hints
2. Create new Indicators class
3. Refactor analyze_price_trend method
4. Add proper docstrings

Progress:
[✓] Step 1: Add imports and type hints (partially complete)
[✓] Step 2: Create Indicators class
[✓] Step 3: Refactor analyze_price_trend
[✓] Step 4: Add docstrings
